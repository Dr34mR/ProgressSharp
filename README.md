Progress Quest re-written in C# .NET 5

I've always enjoyed [Progress Quest](http://progressquest.com/) so I eventually figured why not re-write it in C# to get some experience and re-make something I enjoyed.

The game is still early in development.

Need to still add: 
- Character Creation
- Saving / Loading
- Fix a bunch of bugs
- General quality improvements
